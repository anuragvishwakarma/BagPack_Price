# **Backpack Price Prediction Using Deep Learning**
### Playground Series Season 5 Episode 2 ([Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/overview))

  
- Backpacks are an essential component of daily life, reflecting both utility and style. Predicting the price of a backpack involves understanding a multitude of factors, including brand, material, size, features like laptop compartments and waterproofing, as well as aesthetic choices like style and color.

- This project is dedicated to building a sophisticated **deep learning regression model** to estimate backpack prices based on their attributes. Our work leverages the extensive dataset provided by the Kaggle competition, *Playground Series Season 5 Episode 2*, to develop a data-driven approach that captures nuanced relationships between features.

- The core goal of this project is to **minimize prediction errors** while maximizing the accuracy of the model. To achieve this, the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** serves as our principal evaluation metric, reflecting the precision of our predictions.
